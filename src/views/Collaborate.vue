            Being an animator (I can't draw for crap), I must work with artists regularly to do commissions.

            That's great, because I get to meet amazing artists and wonderful people regularly! :)

            I really want to get into animating comic panels, so if you're an artist who draws these, absolutely hit me up!

                    Basically, I need artists that can properly layer art so it can be animated.
                    
                    This means there is some extra work required at drawing time, however many find this relatively straight-forward with little extra time added to the drawing process.
